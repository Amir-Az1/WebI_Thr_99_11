    <p>HTML is the standard markup language for creating Web pages.</p>
    <p>HTML stands for Hyper Text Markup Language</p>
    <h2>History</h2>
    <h3>Development</h3>
    <p>
      In 1980, physicist Tim Berners-Lee, a contractor at CERN, proposed and prototyped ENQUIRE, a
      system for CERN researchers to use and share documents. In 1989, Berners-Lee wrote a memo
      proposing an Internet-based hypertext system.[3] Berners-Lee specified HTML and wrote the
      browser and server software in late 1990. That year, Berners-Lee and CERN data systems
      engineer Robert Cailliau collaborated on a joint request for funding, but the project was not
      formally adopted by CERN. In his personal notes[4] from 1990 he listed[5] "some of the many
      areas in which hypertext is used" and put an encyclopedia first.

      The first publicly available description of HTML was a document called "HTML Tags", first
      mentioned on the Internet by Tim Berners-Lee in late 1991.[6][7] It describes 18 elements
      comprising the initial, relatively simple design of HTML. Except for the hyperlink tag, these
      were strongly influenced by SGMLguid, an in-house Standard Generalized Markup Language
      (SGML)-based documentation format at CERN. Eleven of these elements still exist in HTML 4.[8]
